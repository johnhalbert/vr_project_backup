# CLI Interface Outstanding Components

Based on a comprehensive review of the current CLI interface codebase and the master todo list, the following components need to be implemented or completed:

## 1. Command Line Parser and Command Structure

The basic command structure is already defined in `main.rs` using the clap crate, but the following improvements are needed:

- [ ] Complete help system with detailed documentation for all commands
- [ ] Implement consistent error handling across all commands
- [ ] Add command aliases for common operations
- [ ] Implement tab completion for commands and arguments
- [ ] Add support for environment variables for configuration

## 2. Configuration Commands

The configuration module (`config.rs`) has basic functionality but needs the following enhancements:

- [ ] Complete implementation of `reset_config` functionality
- [ ] Complete implementation of `export_config` functionality with TOML and JSON support
- [ ] Complete implementation of `import_config` functionality with validation
- [ ] Add configuration diff and comparison tools
- [ ] Implement configuration search functionality
- [ ] Add configuration template support
- [ ] Implement configuration validation with detailed error reporting

## 3. Hardware Commands

The hardware module (`hardware.rs`) has basic functionality but needs the following enhancements:

- [ ] Complete implementation of `diagnose_devices` functionality
- [ ] Add detailed hardware information reporting
- [ ] Implement hardware performance testing
- [ ] Add firmware update capabilities
- [ ] Implement hardware calibration tools
- [ ] Add hardware event monitoring

## 4. System Commands

The system module (`system.rs`) has basic functionality but needs the following enhancements:

- [ ] Complete implementation of `restart_system` functionality
- [ ] Complete implementation of `update_system` functionality
- [ ] Add system backup and restore capabilities
- [ ] Implement system health checks
- [ ] Add system log management
- [ ] Implement system service management

## 5. Monitoring Utilities

The monitoring module (`monitoring.rs`) is currently just a placeholder and needs full implementation:

- [ ] Implement real-time performance monitoring
- [ ] Add resource usage tracking (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- [ ] Implement system health monitoring
- [ ] Add alert configuration and management
- [ ] Implement historical data analysis
- [ ] Add monitoring data export
- [ ] Implement visual performance graphs in terminal

## 6. IPC Commands

The IPC module (`ipc.rs`) is currently just a placeholder and needs full implementation:

- [ ] Implement Unix domain socket management
- [ ] Add D-Bus service control
- [ ] Implement WebSocket server configuration
- [ ] Add message queue monitoring
- [ ] Implement remote procedure call testing
- [ ] Add IPC performance testing

## 7. Security Commands

The security module (`security.rs`) is currently just a placeholder and needs full implementation:

- [ ] Implement authentication management
- [ ] Add authorization control
- [ ] Implement encryption configuration
- [ ] Add certificate management
- [ ] Implement security audit logging
- [ ] Add security policy enforcement
- [ ] Implement security scanning tools

## 8. Scripting Capabilities

Scripting capabilities are mentioned in the master todo but not yet implemented:

- [ ] Design and implement scripting engine
- [ ] Add support for batch command execution
- [ ] Implement conditional execution
- [ ] Add scheduled task management
- [ ] Implement event-triggered actions
- [ ] Add script debugging tools
- [ ] Implement script library management

## 9. Utils Module Enhancements

The utils module needs expansion to support the above functionality:

- [ ] Enhance error handling utilities
- [ ] Improve formatting utilities for consistent output
- [ ] Add logging utilities
- [ ] Implement file handling utilities
- [ ] Add network utilities
- [ ] Implement data conversion utilities

## 10. Testing and Documentation

- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for all CLI commands
- [ ] Implement integration tests with the Core API
- [ ] Add performance tests for CLI operations
- [ ] Create detailed user documentation
- [ ] Implement man pages for all commands
- [ ] Add examples for common use cases

## Next Steps

Based on the master todo list and the current state of the codebase, the implementation should proceed in the following order:

1. Complete the command line parser and command structure
2. Implement configuration commands and utilities
3. Implement monitoring utilities and diagnostic tools
4. Implement scripting capabilities
5. Update all documentation and tests

This implementation plan aligns with the master todo list and will provide a comprehensive CLI interface for the VR headset system.
