## Implementation Details

### Command Line Parser

The command line parser uses the `clap` crate to provide a robust and user-friendly command-line interface. Key features include:

- Hierarchical command structure with subcommands
- Comprehensive argument and option handling
- Detailed help text with examples
- Tab completion for commands and arguments
- Consistent error handling with context and suggestions

### Configuration Commands

The configuration commands provide a comprehensive interface for managing system configuration. Key features include:

- Get/set commands for individual settings
- List command for viewing configuration categories
- Import/export commands for configuration backup
- Validation commands for checking configuration integrity
- Search and diff commands for configuration comparison

### Monitoring Utilities

The monitoring utilities provide real-time and historical monitoring of system metrics. Key features include:

- Status command for overall system health
- Metrics command for detailed performance data
- Alerts command for system warnings and errors
- Logs command for viewing system logs
- Performance command for benchmarking and analysis

### Scripting Capabilities

The scripting capabilities enable automation of common tasks and workflows. Key features include:

- Script execution engine for running command sequences
- Variable substitution for dynamic scripts
- Conditional execution for complex workflows
- Error handling for robust script execution
- Script library for common tasks
- Script sharing for collaboration

## Usage Examples

### Configuration Management

```bash
# List all configuration categories
vr config list

# Get a specific configuration value
vr config get display.brightness

# Set a configuration value
vr config set display.brightness 80

# Export configuration to a file
vr config export /tmp/config_backup.toml

# Import configuration from a file
vr config import /tmp/config_backup.toml

# Compare configurations
vr config diff /tmp/config_backup.toml
```

### System Monitoring

```bash
# Show system status
vr monitoring status

# Show metrics for a specific component
vr monitoring metrics --component cpu --interval 5 --count 10

# Show alerts
vr monitoring alerts --level warning

# Show logs
vr monitoring log --component display --follow

# Generate performance report
vr monitoring performance --duration 60
```

### Hardware Management

```bash
# List all hardware devices
vr hardware list

# Show detailed information for a specific device
vr hardware info --device display

# Run diagnostics on a device
vr hardware diagnose --device camera

# Calibrate a device
vr hardware calibrate --device imu

# Update firmware
vr hardware update --device controller
```

### Scripting

```bash
# Run a script
vr script run /path/to/script.sh

# Create a new script
vr script create my_script.sh --template monitoring

# List available scripts
vr script list

# Edit a script
vr script edit my_script.sh

# Delete a script
vr script delete my_script.sh
```

## Next Steps

The CLI Interface implementation is now complete, providing a comprehensive command-line interface for managing and monitoring the VR Headset system. The next steps in the project include:

1. Implementing Configuration Categories
2. Implementing Production Services
3. Implementing Performance Optimization and Validation

These components will build on the foundation provided by the Core API Layer, Web Interface, and CLI Interface to create a complete system management solution for the VR Headset project.
