   ./install.sh
   \`\`\`

### Usage

The VR OS enhancements are automatically applied during boot. No additional configuration is required.

To monitor the system:
\`\`\`bash
# Check CPU isolation
cat /proc/cmdline | grep isolcpus
cat /proc/cmdline | grep nohz_full
cat /proc/cmdline | grep rcu_nocbs

# Check memory configuration
cat /proc/meminfo | grep Huge
cat /proc/swaps
cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness

# Check IRQ affinity
cat /proc/interrupts
cat /proc/irq/default_smp_affinity

# Check VR services
systemctl status vr-init.service
systemctl status vr-cpu-isolation.service
systemctl status vr-rt-scheduling.service
\`\`\`

## Performance Impact

These enhancements result in:

- More consistent frame rates
- Reduced jitter
- Improved responsiveness
- Better handling of CPU-intensive workloads
- More efficient memory usage

- More consistent performance for VR applications

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### System fails to boot

- Try booting with the default device tree

#### VR applications have high latency

- Check if CPU isolation is working correctly
- Check if real-time scheduling is applied to VR processes
- Check if memory locking is enabled for VR processes

#### System runs out of memory

- Check if huge pages are correctly configured
- Check if ZRAM is working correctly
- Check if memory pressure handling is working correctly

### Logs

The following logs can be used to diagnose issues:

- /var/log/vr/memory-pressure.log
