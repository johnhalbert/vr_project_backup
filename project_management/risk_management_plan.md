## Risk Analysis

### Qualitative Risk Analysis

Risks will be assessed qualitatively using the following scales:

**Probability Scale**:
- Very Low (10%): Highly unlikely to occur
- Low (30%): Unlikely to occur
- Medium (50%): May occur
- High (70%): Likely to occur
- Very High (90%): Highly likely to occur

**Impact Scale**:
- Very Low (0.1): Minimal impact on project objectives
- Low (0.3): Minor impact on project objectives
- Medium (0.5): Moderate impact on project objectives
- High (0.7): Significant impact on project objectives
- Very High (0.9): Critical impact on project objectives

**Risk Score Calculation**:
- Risk Score = Probability × Impact
- Risk Priority:
  - Low Priority: 0.01-0.14
  - Medium Priority: 0.15-0.39
  - High Priority: 0.40-0.81

### Quantitative Risk Analysis

For high-priority risks, quantitative analysis will be performed using:

1. **Expected Monetary Value (EMV)**: Calculating the financial impact of risks
2. **Decision Tree Analysis**: Evaluating different response options
3. **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Modeling schedule and cost uncertainties
4. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Determining which risks have the most impact on project objectives

## Risk Response Strategies

### Threat Response Strategies

1. **Avoid**: Eliminate the threat by eliminating the cause
2. **Transfer**: Shift the impact of the threat to a third party
3. **Mitigate**: Reduce the probability or impact of the threat
4. **Accept**: Acknowledge the threat but take no proactive action

### Opportunity Response Strategies

1. **Exploit**: Ensure the opportunity is realized
2. **Share**: Allocate ownership of the opportunity to a third party
3. **Enhance**: Increase the probability or impact of the opportunity
4. **Accept**: Take advantage of the opportunity if it occurs

## Risk Monitoring and Control
