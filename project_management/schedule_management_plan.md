### Activity Sequencing

Activities are sequenced based on logical relationships and dependencies. The following dependency types are used:

- **Finish-to-Start (FS)**: A successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity has finished
- **Start-to-Start (SS)**: A successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity has started
- **Finish-to-Finish (FF)**: A successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activity has finished
- **Start-to-Finish (SF)**: A successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activity has started

### Activity Duration Estimating

Activity durations are estimated using the following techniques:

- **Expert Judgment**: Based on experience with similar activities
- **Analogous Estimating**: Using actual durations from similar activities in previous projects
- **Parametric Estimating**: Using mathematical models to calculate durations based on parameters
- **Three-Point Estimating**: Using optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic estimates to calculate expected duration

### Resource Assignment

Resources are assigned to activities based on:

- Required skills and expertise
- Resource availability
- Resource capacity
- Resource constraints

### Schedule Development Tools

The project schedule is developed and maintained using the following tools:

- Microsoft Project for detailed schedule development
- Jira for sprint planning and tracking
- Confluence for schedule documentation and communication
