# VR Headset Troubleshooting Guide

## Display Issues

### Blurry Display
**Symptoms:**
- Text or objects appear blurry
- Unable to focus clearly on content
- Inconsistent clarity across the field of view

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**

1. **Incorrect Headset Position**
   - Adjust the headset position up, down, and side to side until the display is clearest
   - Ensure the headset is centered on your face
   - Tighten the head strap to prevent shifting during movement

2. **Incorrect IPD (Interpupillary Distance) Setting**
   - Adjust the IPD slider on the bottom of the headset to match your eye spacing
   - Move the slider slowly and find the position where text is sharpest
   - For fine-tuning, use the digital IPD adjustment in Settings > Hardware > Display > IPD Adjustment

3. **Dirty Lenses**
   - Clean the lenses with the included microfiber cloth using gentle circular motions
   - Never use liquid cleaners, alcohol wipes, or paper towels on lenses
   - Check for smudges, fingerprints, or debris

4. **Condensation**
   - If moving from a cold to warm environment, allow the headset to acclimate before use
   - Use a microfiber cloth to gently remove any condensation
   - Run the headset for a few minutes to warm up the lenses

5. **Software Resolution Settings**
   - Check display resolution settings in Settings > Hardware > Display > Resolution
   - Try increasing the resolution if set to a lower value
   - Some applications may have their own resolution settings to adjust

6. **Eye Conditions**
   - If you normally wear corrective lenses, wear them in VR (if they fit)
   - Consider prescription lens inserts (sold separately)
   - Consult an eye care professional if problems persist

### Display Artifacts or Dead Pixels
**Symptoms:**
- Persistent dots, lines, or areas that don't display correctly
- Pixels that remain one color or don't change
- Flickering or flashing in specific areas

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**

1. **Verify the Issue**
   - Run the display test: Settings > System > Diagnostics > Display Test
   - Note the location and nature of any artifacts
   - Try different content to confirm the issue persists across applications

2. **Software Glitches**
   - Restart the headset by holding the power button for 10 seconds, then turning it back on
   - Check for system updates: Settings > System > Updates
   - Try resetting display settings: Settings > Hardware > Display > Reset Display Settings

3. **Overheating**
   - Allow the headset to cool down if it feels warm
   - Ensure ventilation openings aren't blocked
   - Use in a moderately cool environment

4. **Hardware Issues**
   - If dead pixels or persistent artifacts are confirmed, contact customer support
   - This may be covered under warranty
   - Provide the results of the display test to support

### God Rays or Lens Flare
**Symptoms:**
- Visible rays or streaks of light emanating from bright objects against dark backgrounds
- Circular glare or halo effects around bright elements

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**

1. **Normal Lens Characteristics**
   - Some level of god rays is normal with Fresnel lenses
   - The effect is most noticeable in high-contrast scenes (bright objects on dark backgrounds)

2. **Headset Positioning**
   - Adjust the headset position to find the sweet spot where rays are minimized
   - Ensure the center of the lens aligns with your eyes

3. **Content Adjustments**
   - Reduce brightness in Settings > Hardware > Display > Brightness
   - Look for in-app settings that might reduce contrast
   - Avoid apps with extreme contrast in critical use cases

4. **Dirty Lenses**
   - Clean lenses with the microfiber cloth
   - Check for smudges that might increase the effect

### Screen Door Effect
**Symptoms:**
- Visible grid-like pattern over the entire display
- Appearance of looking through a fine mesh or screen door

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**

1. **Normal Display Characteristic**
   - Some visibility of the pixel structure is normal with current VR displays
   - The effect varies based on content and contrast

2. **Mitigation Strategies**
   - Increase the resolution setting: Settings > Hardware > Display > Resolution
   - Enable anti-aliasing in applications that support it
   - Focus on content rather than looking for the effect (it becomes less noticeable over time)
   - Use applications with detailed, colorful content where the effect is less visible

3. **Display Settings**
   - Try different brightness levels
   - Adjust contrast settings if available
   - Some users find slight adjustments to color settings can reduce the perception of the effect
