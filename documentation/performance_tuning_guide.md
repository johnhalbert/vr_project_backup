# VR Headset Performance Tuning Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides developers with strategies and techniques for optimizing the performance of applications running on the VR headset platform. Achieving high and consistent performance is crucial for delivering comfortable and immersive VR experiences. This guide focuses on optimizations specific to the Orange Pi CM5 (16GB variant) hardware and the VR headset SDK.

## Performance Goals

For optimal VR experiences, applications should strive to meet the following performance targets:

- **Frame Rate:** Consistently maintain 90 FPS or higher.
- **Motion-to-Photon Latency:** Keep below 20ms.
- **CPU Usage:** Avoid sustained high CPU usage across all cores.
- **GPU Usage:** Maintain GPU utilization below 90% to allow headroom.
- **Memory Usage:** Stay within reasonable memory limits to avoid swapping or out-of-memory issues.
- **Power Consumption:** Optimize for reasonable battery life during typical usage.

## Profiling Tools

Effective optimization starts with accurate profiling. The VR headset SDK provides several tools for performance analysis:

1.  **VR Performance Profiler:**
    -   Real-time monitoring of CPU, GPU, and memory usage.
    -   Frame timing analysis (CPU time, GPU time, latency).
    -   Detailed breakdown of rendering stages.
    -   Identifies performance bottlenecks.
    -   Usage: `vr-sdk profile --app <YourApp>`

2.  **System Trace:**
    -   Captures detailed system-level activity (CPU scheduling, interrupts, memory events).
    -   Useful for diagnosing complex performance issues.
    -   Usage: `vr-sdk trace --app <YourApp> --duration 10s`

3.  **GPU Debugger:**
    -   Inspect GPU state, shader performance, and memory usage.
    -   Analyze rendering pipeline bottlenecks.
    -   Requires connecting via the SDK debugger tools.

4.  **Memory Profiler:**
    -   Tracks memory allocations and identifies leaks.
    -   Analyzes memory usage patterns.
    -   Usage: `vr-sdk memory-profile --app <YourApp>`

5.  **In-App Profiling API:**
    -   Use `vr::profiling::beginSection()` and `vr::profiling::endSection()` to measure specific code blocks.
    -   Access results via `vr::profiling::getResults()`.

## CPU Optimization Techniques

### Multithreading and Job Systems

-   **Utilize All Cores:** The RK3588S has 8 cores (4x A76, 4x A55). Distribute work effectively.
-   **Job System:** Use the SDK's job system (`vr::JobSystem`) for fine-grained task parallelism.
-   **Avoid Main Thread Blocking:** Offload heavy computations (physics, AI, complex logic) to worker threads.
-   **Thread Affinity:** Consider setting thread affinity for critical tasks (e.g., rendering thread on A76 cores).

```cpp
// Example: Offloading physics update
vr::JobSystem::createJob([](void* userData) {
    PhysicsEngine* engine = static_cast<PhysicsEngine*>(userData);
    engine->updateSimulation(0.016f); // Assuming 60Hz physics update
}, physicsEngineInstance);
```

### Code Optimization

-   **Algorithm Choice:** Select efficient algorithms, especially for frequently executed code.
-   **Cache Optimization:** Arrange data structures and access patterns to maximize cache locality (Data-Oriented Design).
-   **SIMD Instructions (NEON):** Use NEON intrinsics for vectorizable computations (math, image processing).
-   **Reduce Branching:** Minimize conditional branches in performance-critical loops.
-   **Function Inlining:** Use `inline` judiciously for small, frequently called functions.

### System-Level Optimization

-   **Process Priority:** Set appropriate priorities for application threads using `vr::system::setThreadPriority()`.
-   **CPU Governor:** The system manages the CPU governor, but be aware of its impact. Profile under different load conditions.

## GPU Optimization Techniques

### Reducing Draw Calls

-   **Batching:** Group objects with the same material and shaders into single draw calls.
    -   Static Batching: Combine static geometry at load time.
    -   Dynamic Batching: Combine small dynamic objects at runtime.
    -   Instancing: Draw multiple instances of the same mesh with one call.
-   **Material Atlasing:** Combine textures for different objects into a single atlas to reduce material switches.

```cpp
// Example: Using instancing
vr::rendering::Mesh* myMesh = vr::assets::loadMesh("models/rock.obj");
vr::rendering::Material* myMaterial = vr::assets::loadMaterial("materials/rock.mat");

std::vector<vr::math::Matrix4> instanceTransforms;
// Populate instanceTransforms with positions/rotations/scales

vr::rendering::drawInstanced(myMesh, myMaterial, instanceTransforms);
```

### Shader Optimization

-   **Complexity:** Keep shaders as simple as possible. Avoid complex calculations in pixel shaders.
-   **Texture Lookups:** Minimize texture lookups. Use texture arrays or atlases.
-   **Branching:** Avoid conditional branching within shaders, especially fragment shaders.
-   **Precision:** Use appropriate precision qualifiers (`highp`, `mediump`, `lowp`). Use `mediump` where possible.
-   **Shader Compiler:** Use the SDK's offline shader compiler (`vr-sdk compile-shaders`) for optimized shaders.

### Rendering Techniques

-   **Level of Detail (LOD):** Use simpler meshes and materials for objects far from the camera.
-   **Occlusion Culling:** Use the SDK's occlusion culling (`vr::rendering::setOcclusionCulling()`) to avoid rendering hidden objects.
-   **Foveated Rendering:** If supported by the hardware/SDK version, enable foveated rendering to reduce shading cost in the periphery.
-   **Render Scale:** Adjust the render target resolution (`vr::rendering::setRenderScale()`) dynamically based on performance.
-   **Anti-Aliasing:** Choose the most efficient AA method that meets quality requirements (e.g., FXAA vs. MSAA).

### Asset Optimization

-   **Texture Compression:** Use appropriate compression formats (e.g., ASTC for Mali GPUs).
-   **Mipmapping:** Always generate mipmaps for textures to improve cache performance and reduce aliasing.
-   **Mesh Complexity:** Optimize polygon counts. Use normal maps for detail instead of high-poly meshes where possible.

## Memory Optimization Techniques

### Reducing Memory Usage

-   **Asset Streaming:** Load assets asynchronously and only when needed, especially for large environments.
-   **Texture Resolution:** Use appropriate texture sizes. Avoid excessively large textures.
-   **Memory Pools:** Use custom allocators or memory pools for frequent, small allocations to reduce fragmentation and overhead.
-   **Data Structures:** Choose memory-efficient data structures.

### Avoiding Memory Leaks

-   **Smart Pointers:** Use `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr` for automatic memory management.
-   **Memory Profiler:** Regularly use the memory profiler to detect leaks.
-   **Resource Management:** Implement robust resource management systems (e.g., reference counting for shared assets).

### Optimizing Memory Access

-   **Cache Locality:** Arrange data for sequential access whenever possible.
-   **Avoid Pointer Chasing:** Minimize indirections in performance-critical code.
-   **Memory Alignment:** Ensure data structures are properly aligned for efficient access.

```cpp
// Example: Simple memory pool
class SimplePool {
    std::vector<uint8_t> memory;
    std::vector<void*> freeList;
    size_t chunkSize;
public:
    SimplePool(size_t initialChunks, size_t size) : chunkSize(size) {
        memory.resize(initialChunks * chunkSize);
        for (size_t i = 0; i < initialChunks; ++i) {
            freeList.push_back(memory.data() + i * chunkSize);
        }
    }
    void* allocate() {
        if (freeList.empty()) return nullptr; // Or grow pool
        void* ptr = freeList.back();
        freeList.pop_back();
        return ptr;
    }
    void free(void* ptr) {
        freeList.push_back(ptr);
    }
};
```

## Storage Optimization Techniques

### Loading Times

-   **Asset Packaging:** Package related assets together into archives for faster loading.
-   **Asynchronous Loading:** Load assets on background threads to avoid blocking the main thread.
-   **Compression:** Use efficient compression algorithms for assets, balancing load time and file size.
-   **Read-Ahead:** Utilize system read-ahead hints if possible, though often managed by the OS.

### I/O Patterns

-   **Minimize Small Reads/Writes:** Aggregate I/O operations where possible.
-   **Sequential Access:** Prefer sequential file access over random access when feasible.
-   **Caching:** Implement application-level caching for frequently accessed data that doesn't change often.

## Network Optimization Techniques

### Reducing Latency

-   **Packet Aggregation:** Combine small messages into larger packets (beware of increasing latency for individual messages).
-   **Protocol Choice:** Use UDP for time-sensitive data (like player positions) and TCP for reliable data.
-   **Server Location:** Optimize server placement for lower ping times to target user base.

### Reducing Bandwidth

-   **Data Compression:** Compress network payloads.
-   **Delta Compression:** Send only changes since the last update, not the full state.
-   **Interest Management:** Only send data relevant to each client.
-   **Quantization:** Reduce the precision of floating-point values (e.g., positions, rotations) before sending.

```cpp
// Example: Quantizing a rotation quaternion
struct QuantizedQuaternion {
    int16_t x, y, z, w;
};

QuantizedQuaternion quantize(const vr::math::Quaternion& q) {
    return {
        static_cast<int16_t>(q.x * 32767.0f),
        static_cast<int16_t>(q.y * 32767.0f),
        static_cast<int16_t>(q.z * 32767.0f),
        static_cast<int16_t>(q.w * 32767.0f)
    };
}

vr::math::Quaternion dequantize(const QuantizedQuaternion& qq) {
    vr::math::Quaternion q(
        qq.x / 32767.0f,
        qq.y / 32767.0f,
        qq.z / 32767.0f,
        qq.w / 32767.0f
    );
    return vr::math::normalize(q);
}
```

### Connection Management

-   **Keep-Alive:** Use keep-alive messages to maintain connections and detect drops quickly.
-   **Reconnection Logic:** Implement robust reconnection mechanisms.

## Power Optimization Techniques

### Reducing CPU/GPU Load

-   Many performance optimizations also save power.
-   **Dynamic Quality Scaling:** Reduce rendering quality or simulation complexity when running on battery or when thermal limits are reached.
-   **Sleep Modes:** Allow the system to enter lower power states when idle.

### Peripheral Management

-   **Wi-Fi/Bluetooth:** Reduce polling frequency or disable when not needed.
-   **Display Brightness:** Allow users to adjust brightness; consider adaptive brightness.
-   **Haptics:** Use haptic feedback judiciously.

### Power Profiles

-   Utilize the system's power profiles (`vr::power::setPowerProfile()`) to balance performance and battery life.
-   Adapt application behavior based on the current power profile (`vr::power::getCurrentPowerProfile()`).

```cpp
void App::update() {
    vr::PowerProfile profile = vr::power::getCurrentPowerProfile();
    float updateRate = 60.0f;
    if (profile == vr::PowerProfile::PowerSaving) {
        updateRate = 30.0f; // Reduce update frequency in power saving mode
    }
    
    if (timeSinceLastUpdate > (1.0f / updateRate)) {
        // Perform update logic
        timeSinceLastUpdate = 0.0f;
    }
}
```

## Platform-Specific Optimizations (Orange Pi CM5 / RK3588S)

-   **NEON:** Leverage ARM NEON for SIMD operations.
-   **Mali GPU:** Be mindful of Mali GPU architecture characteristics (e.g., tile-based rendering). Minimize overdraw.
-   **NPU:** If your application involves AI/ML tasks, utilize the RK3588S NPU via appropriate libraries (e.g., RKNN Toolkit) for significant performance and power savings.
-   **Memory Bandwidth:** Profile memory bandwidth usage. Optimize data layouts and access patterns.
-   **Thermal Management:** The system handles thermal throttling. Monitor performance under sustained load using the profiler to understand thermal impacts.
