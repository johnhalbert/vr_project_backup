# VR Headset Security Hardening Guide

This guide provides comprehensive security hardening recommendations for developers working with the VR headset system. It covers authentication, authorization, encryption, network security, and update security to ensure the system remains secure against various threats.

## 1. Authentication Best Practices

### 1.1 Token Management

The VR headset system uses token-based authentication to secure access to various APIs and services. Follow these best practices for token management:

```rust
// Example of proper token generation in Rust
use rand::{thread_rng, Rng};
use base64::{engine::general_purpose, Engine};

fn generate_secure_token(length: usize) -> String {
    let mut rng = thread_rng();
    let random_bytes: Vec<u8> = (0..length).map(|_| rng.gen()).collect();
    general_purpose::STANDARD.encode(random_bytes)
}
```

#### Key Recommendations:

- Use cryptographically secure random number generators for token creation
- Implement proper token expiration (recommended: 1 hour for access tokens, 7 days for refresh tokens)
- Store token hashes, not the tokens themselves
- Implement token revocation mechanisms for security incidents
- Use separate tokens for different security domains (e.g., user access vs. device access)
- Include device fingerprinting in token validation for critical operations

### 1.2 Session Handling

Proper session management is critical for maintaining security while providing a seamless user experience:

#### Key Recommendations:

- Implement automatic session timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Use secure, HTTP-only cookies with the SameSite attribute for web interfaces
- Regenerate session IDs after authentication state changes
- Maintain a session registry to enable forced logout capabilities
- Implement session validation that checks user agent consistency
- Provide users with the ability to view and terminate active sessions

### 1.3 Password Policies

While the VR headset system primarily uses token-based authentication, password policies are still important for initial account setup and recovery:

#### Key Recommendations:

- Enforce minimum password length of 12 characters
- Require a mix of character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
- Check passwords against common password lists
- Implement account lockout after 5 failed attempts (with exponential backoff)
- Use secure password hashing with Argon2id with appropriate parameters:
  - Memory: 64 MiB
  - Iterations: 3
  - Parallelism: 4
- Require password changes every 90 days for administrative accounts
- Implement secure password reset mechanisms with time-limited tokens

## 2. Authorization Controls

### 2.1 Role-Based Access Control

The VR headset system implements a comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) system:

```rust
// Example of role-based permission check
pub fn check_permission(user: &User, resource: &Resource, action: Action) -> Result<(), AuthError> {
    let user_roles = user.get_roles();
    
    for role in user_roles {
        if role.has_permission(resource, action) {
            return Ok(());
        }
    }
    
    Err(AuthError::InsufficientPermissions)
}
```

#### Key Recommendations:

- Define clear roles with minimal necessary permissions
- Implement standard roles: User, Power User, Developer, Administrator
- Create custom roles for specific use cases
- Document all roles and their associated permissions
- Audit role assignments regularly
- Implement role inheritance to simplify management

### 2.2 Permission Management

Fine-grained permission management allows for precise control over system access:

#### Key Recommendations:

- Define permissions at the resource and action level
- Group related permissions into logical sets
- Implement permission verification at API boundaries
- Cache permission checks to improve performance
- Log permission denials for security monitoring
- Provide a permission management interface for administrators

### 2.3 Least Privilege Principle

Adhering to the principle of least privilege is essential for minimizing security risks:

#### Key Recommendations:

- Grant minimal permissions required for each role
- Implement time-bound elevated privileges for maintenance tasks
- Use separate accounts for administrative and regular use
- Regularly review and prune unnecessary permissions
- Implement just-in-time privilege elevation with approval workflows
- Audit privilege usage to identify potential reductions

## 3. Encryption Implementation

### 3.1 Key Management

Proper key management is fundamental to the security of encrypted data:

```rust
// Example of key rotation implementation
pub struct KeyManager {
    active_key_id: String,
    keys: HashMap<String, EncryptionKey>,
    rotation_interval: Duration,
}

impl KeyManager {
    pub fn rotate_keys(&mut self) -> Result<(), KeyError> {
        let new_key = EncryptionKey::generate()?;
        let new_key_id = Uuid::new_v4().to_string();
        
        self.keys.insert(new_key_id.clone(), new_key);
        self.active_key_id = new_key_id;
        
        // Prune old keys beyond retention policy
        self.prune_old_keys();
        
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

#### Key Recommendations:

- Use a hardware security module (HSM) when available
- Implement key rotation policies (90 days recommended)
- Separate keys by purpose (encryption, signing, authentication)
- Use key derivation functions to generate keys from master keys
- Implement secure key backup and recovery procedures
- Never store encryption keys in plaintext or in code

### 3.2 Algorithm Selection

Choosing appropriate cryptographic algorithms is critical for long-term security:

#### Key Recommendations:

- Use AES-256-GCM for symmetric encryption
- Use RSA-4096 or ECC P-384 for asymmetric encryption
- Use HMAC-SHA-256 for message authentication
- Use Argon2id for password hashing
- Use Ed25519 for digital signatures
- Maintain an algorithm transition plan for cryptographic agility

### 3.3 Secure Storage

Protecting sensitive data at rest requires secure storage mechanisms:

#### Key Recommendations:

- Encrypt all sensitive data before storage
- Use envelope encryption for large datasets
- Implement secure deletion with multiple overwrites
- Use platform security features (e.g., Trusted Platform Module)
- Separate encryption keys from encrypted data
- Implement integrity verification for stored data

## 4. Network Security

### 4.1 Firewall Configuration

Proper firewall configuration is the first line of defense for network security:

#### Key Recommendations:

- Implement default-deny policies
- Open only necessary ports for required services
- Use stateful packet inspection
- Implement rate limiting for public-facing services
- Configure logging for blocked traffic
- Regularly audit firewall rules

### 4.2 VPN Setup

For remote access to development environments and administrative interfaces:

#### Key Recommendations:

- Use WireGuard or OpenVPN with strong encryption
- Implement certificate-based authentication
- Enable perfect forward secrecy
- Configure split tunneling appropriately
- Implement network-level access controls
- Regularly rotate VPN credentials

### 4.3 Intrusion Detection

Detecting and responding to potential security incidents:

#### Key Recommendations:

- Deploy network-based intrusion detection systems
- Implement host-based intrusion detection
- Configure alerts for suspicious activities
- Establish baseline network behavior
- Monitor for unusual data transfer patterns
- Create an incident response plan for detected intrusions

## 5. Update Security

### 5.1 Package Verification

Ensuring the integrity and authenticity of software updates:

```rust
// Example of update package verification
pub fn verify_package(package: &UpdatePackage) -> Result<(), VerificationError> {
    // Verify package signature
    if !verify_signature(&package.data, &package.signature, &PUBLIC_KEY) {
        return Err(VerificationError::InvalidSignature);
    }
    
    // Verify package hash
    let calculated_hash = calculate_hash(&package.data);
    if calculated_hash != package.hash {
        return Err(VerificationError::HashMismatch);
    }
    
    // Verify package metadata
    if !verify_metadata(&package.metadata) {
        return Err(VerificationError::InvalidMetadata);
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

#### Key Recommendations:

- Sign all update packages with strong cryptographic signatures
- Implement multi-stage verification (signature, hash, metadata)
- Use a secure boot process to verify system integrity
- Maintain a chain of trust from boot to application
- Implement tamper-evident packaging
- Verify updates before installation

### 5.2 Secure Distribution

Distributing updates securely to prevent tampering:

#### Key Recommendations:

- Use HTTPS for all update downloads
- Implement certificate pinning for update servers
- Use content delivery networks with integrity verification
- Implement bandwidth throttling to prevent DoS
- Provide update mirrors with cross-verification
- Implement staged rollouts for critical updates

### 5.3 Rollback Protection

Preventing security downgrades through malicious rollbacks:

#### Key Recommendations:

- Maintain a minimum security version
- Prevent rollback to versions with known vulnerabilities

}

impl AuthManager {
    pub fn authenticate(&self, username: &str, password: &str) -> Result<AuthToken, AuthError> {
        let user = self.get_user(username)?;
        
        // Check if account is locked
        if user.is_locked() {
            return Err(AuthError::AccountLocked);
        }
        
        // Verify password
        if !self.verify_password(password, &user.password_hash)? {
            self.record_failed_attempt(&user)?;
            return Err(AuthError::InvalidCredentials);
        }
        
        // Reset failed attempts on successful login
        self.reset_failed_attempts(&user)?;
        
        // Generate authentication token
        let token = self.generate_token(&user)?;
        
        Ok(token)
    }
    
    fn verify_password(&self, password: &str, hash: &str) -> Result<bool, AuthError> {
        // Use constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks
        Ok(argon2::verify_encoded(hash, password.as_bytes())?)
    }
    
    fn generate_token(&self, user: &User) -> Result<AuthToken, AuthError> {
        // Generate secure random token
        let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
        let token_bytes: [u8; 32] = rng.gen();
        let token = base64::encode(&token_bytes);
        
        // Create token with expiration
        let expiration = SystemTime::now() + self.token_validity;
        let auth_token = AuthToken {
            token,
            user_id: user.id.clone(),
            expiration,
            scope: user.get_scope(),
        };
        
        // Store token hash in database
        self.store_token_hash(&auth_token)?;
        
        Ok(auth_token)
    }
}
```

### 6.2 Implementing Secure Data Storage

```rust
// Example implementation of secure data storage
use aes_gcm::{Aes256Gcm, Key, Nonce};
use aes_gcm::aead::{Aead, NewAead};

pub struct SecureStorage {
    key_manager: KeyManager,
}

impl SecureStorage {
    pub fn store_data(&self, data: &[u8], metadata: &Metadata) -> Result<StoredData, StorageError> {
        // Get current encryption key
        let encryption_key = self.key_manager.get_active_key()?;
        
        // Generate random nonce
        let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
        let nonce_bytes: [u8; 12] = rng.gen();
        let nonce = Nonce::from_slice(&nonce_bytes);
        
        // Encrypt data
        let cipher = Aes256Gcm::new(Key::from_slice(encryption_key.as_bytes()));
        let encrypted_data = cipher.encrypt(nonce, data)
            .map_err(|_| StorageError::EncryptionFailed)?;
        
        // Create stored data object
        let stored_data = StoredData {
            encrypted_data,
            nonce: nonce_bytes.to_vec(),
            key_id: encryption_key.id.clone(),
            metadata: metadata.clone(),
            created_at: SystemTime::now(),
        };
        
        // Store in database
        self.save_to_database(&stored_data)?;
        
        Ok(stored_data)
    }
    
    pub fn retrieve_data(&self, id: &str) -> Result<Vec<u8>, StorageError> {
        // Retrieve stored data
        let stored_data = self.get_from_database(id)?;
        
        // Get encryption key
        let encryption_key = self.key_manager.get_key(&stored_data.key_id)?;
        
        // Decrypt data
        let cipher = Aes256Gcm::new(Key::from_slice(encryption_key.as_bytes()));
        let nonce = Nonce::from_slice(&stored_data.nonce);
        
        let decrypted_data = cipher.decrypt(nonce, stored_data.encrypted_data.as_ref())
            .map_err(|_| StorageError::DecryptionFailed)?;
        
        Ok(decrypted_data)
    }
}
```
