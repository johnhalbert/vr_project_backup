**Title: Getting Started with Your VR Headset**

### Introduction (0:00-0:15)
Welcome to your new VR headset! In this video, we'll guide you through unboxing your device, setting it up for the first time, and getting started with basic navigation. Let's begin!

### Unboxing (0:15-0:45)
Your VR headset package includes:
- The VR headset with adjustable head strap
- Two hand controllers

Before we begin setup, let's charge the headset. Connect the USB-C cable to the port on the left side of the headset and plug it into the power adapter. The LED indicator will pulse slowly while charging and turn solid green when fully charged.

### Physical Adjustment (0:45-1:30)
Now, let's adjust the headset for comfort:
1. Loosen all straps before putting on the headset
2. Place the headset on your face, positioning it so the display is clear
3. Tighten the top strap first to secure the headset
4. Then adjust the side straps for a snug but comfortable fit
5. Use the IPD slider on the bottom of the headset to adjust the lens spacing until the image is sharpest

[Visual: Demonstrate each adjustment step]

Remember, the headset should feel secure but not tight. If you wear glasses, make sure they fit comfortably inside the headset.

### Power On and Initial Setup (1:30-2:30)
To power on your headset, press and hold the power button on the right side for 2 seconds.

You'll see the startup logo, followed by the setup wizard. The wizard will guide you through:
1. Selecting your language
2. Connecting to WiFi
3. Creating or signing into your user account
4. Setting up your play area
5. Pairing your controllers

[Visual: Show each setup screen and demonstrate the process]

For room-scale experiences, you'll need to clear a space of at least 2m x 2m. Follow the on-screen instructions to trace your play boundary using your controller.

### Basic Navigation (2:30-3:30)
Now that your headset is set up, let's cover basic navigation:

Your controllers function as your hands in VR. The trigger button is your primary selection tool. Point the laser at an item and pull the trigger to select it.
