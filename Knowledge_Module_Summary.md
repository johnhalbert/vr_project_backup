## Technical Preferences

### User Preference for Rust for User-Space Applications
- **ID**: user_18
- **Use When**: When implementing user-space applications or custom software outside of drivers and OS for the VR headset project

### VR Headset SLAM System Testing Preferences
- **ID**: user_14
- **Use When**: When planning or performing testing and validation for components of the VR headset SLAM system project
- **Content**: When performing testing and validation for the VR headset SLAM system project components, prioritize Unit Testing, Integration Testing, Simulation Testing, and Performance Testing (if achievable purely in software).

### Multi-tiered Configuration UI Preference
- **ID**: user_17
- **Use When**: When designing or implementing configuration user interfaces with varying levels of complexity
- **Content**: When designing configuration user interfaces, prioritize a multi-tiered system with quickly accessible common items and advanced sections for comprehensive options.

### CLI Interface Best Practices
- **ID**: user_30
- **Use When**: When designing and implementing command-line interfaces for the VR headset project
- **Content**: CLI interfaces should follow these best practices: (1) Provide comprehensive help text with examples, (2) Support multiple output formats (text, table, JSON), (3) Include tab completion for commands and arguments, (4) Implement consistent error handling with context and suggestions, (5) Support scripting capabilities for automation, and (6) Provide both simple quick-access commands and advanced detailed options.
