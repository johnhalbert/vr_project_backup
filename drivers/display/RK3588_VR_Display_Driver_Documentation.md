# RK3588 VR Display Driver Documentation

## Overview

The RK3588 VR Display Driver is a specialized Linux kernel driver designed for virtual reality applications on the Rockchip RK3588 SoC. This driver extends the standard DRM/KMS framework with VR-specific features to support the unique requirements of head-mounted displays, including low persistence mode, distortion correction, chromatic aberration compensation, and synchronized dual-display output.

## Key Features

### VR-Specific Display Modes
- **Normal Mode**: Standard display operation
- **Low Persistence Mode**: Reduces motion blur by strobing the backlight
- **Direct Mode**: Bypasses the compositor for lowest latency
- **Async Mode**: Allows asynchronous updates for time warp

### Multi-Display Synchronization
- **Independent Mode**: Each display operates independently
- **Master Mode**: One display acts as the synchronization master
- **Slave Mode**: Display follows the master's timing
- **External Mode**: Synchronization from external source

### Distortion Correction
- **None**: No distortion correction
- **Barrel**: Hardware-accelerated barrel distortion correction
- **Pincushion**: Hardware-accelerated pincushion distortion correction
- **Mesh**: Custom mesh-based distortion correction
- **Custom**: User-defined distortion correction

### Chromatic Aberration Compensation
- **None**: No chromatic aberration compensation
- **RGB**: Standard RGB chromatic aberration correction
- **Custom**: User-defined chromatic aberration correction

### Motion Compensation
- **None**: No motion compensation
- **Predict**: Predictive motion compensation
- **Extrapolate**: Extrapolation-based motion compensation

### Low-Latency Features
- **Fast Path**: Optimized rendering path for reduced latency
- **Bypass Options**: Selectively bypass processing stages for reduced latency
- **Async Commit**: Asynchronous buffer commits for reduced latency

## Integration with ORB-SLAM3

The RK3588 VR Display Driver is designed to work seamlessly with the ORB-SLAM3 system for VR applications:

1. **Low-Latency Output**: The driver's direct mode and fast path options minimize the motion-to-photon latency, which is critical for VR SLAM applications.

2. **Distortion Correction**: The driver handles lens distortion correction in hardware, reducing CPU/GPU load for the SLAM system.

3. **Motion Compensation**: The driver's motion compensation features can use pose data from the SLAM system to reduce perceived latency.

4. **Dual Display Synchronization**: The driver ensures both eye displays are perfectly synchronized, which is essential for comfortable VR experiences.

## Usage Examples

### Initialization

```c
struct rk3588_vr_display *vrd;
int ret;

/* Allocate and initialize the driver */
vrd = kzalloc(sizeof(*vrd), GFP_KERNEL);
if (!vrd)
    return -ENOMEM;

/* Initialize the driver */
ret = rk3588_vr_display_init(vrd);
if (ret) {
    kfree(vrd);
    return ret;
}
```

### Setting VR Mode

```c
/* Set low persistence mode */
ret = rk3588_vr_display_set_mode(vrd, RK3588_VR_MODE_LOW_PERSISTENCE);
if (ret)
    pr_err("Failed to set low persistence mode: %d\n", ret);

/* Set direct mode for lowest latency */
ret = rk3588_vr_display_set_mode(vrd, RK3588_VR_MODE_DIRECT);
if (ret)
    pr_err("Failed to set direct mode: %d\n", ret);
```

### Configuring Distortion Correction

```c
/* Set barrel distortion correction */
ret = rk3588_vr_display_set_distortion_mode(vrd, RK3588_VR_DISTORTION_BARREL);
if (ret)
    pr_err("Failed to set barrel distortion: %d\n", ret);

/* Set custom distortion map */
ret = rk3588_vr_display_set_distortion_map(vrd, 0, map_data, map_size);
if (ret)
    pr_err("Failed to set distortion map: %d\n", ret);
```

### Synchronizing Dual Displays

```c
/* Set master-slave synchronization */
ret = rk3588_vr_display_set_sync_mode(vrd, RK3588_VR_SYNC_MASTER);
if (ret)
    pr_err("Failed to set sync mode: %d\n", ret);
```

### Optimizing for Low Latency

```c
/* Enable fast path */
ret = rk3588_vr_display_set_fast_path(vrd, true);
if (ret)
    pr_err("Failed to enable fast path: %d\n", ret);

/* Bypass non-essential processing */
ret = rk3588_vr_display_set_bypass_options(vrd, true, false, true, false);
if (ret)
    pr_err("Failed to set bypass options: %d\n", ret);
```

## Testing and Validation

The driver includes comprehensive test suites:

1. **Unit Tests**: Verify individual functions and methods
2. **Simulation Tests**: Test driver behavior with simulated hardware
