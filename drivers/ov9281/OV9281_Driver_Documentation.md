## Overview

The OV9281 Camera Driver is a Linux kernel module designed for the OV9281 global shutter monochrome camera sensor, specifically optimized for VR headset applications. This driver provides high-performance frame acquisition with multi-camera synchronization capabilities, zero-copy buffer sharing with the TPU, and specialized VR operation modes.

## Key Features

- **High Frame Rate Support**: Up to 180 FPS operation for smooth VR tracking
- **Multi-Camera Synchronization**: Master-slave configuration for synchronized frame acquisition
- **Zero-Copy Buffer Management**: Direct DMA buffer sharing with the TPU for minimal latency
- **VR-Specific Optimizations**: Low-latency modes and exposure control optimized for VR
- **Flexible Configuration**: Support for various resolutions, frame rates, and operation modes
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Robust error detection and recovery mechanisms

## Architecture

The driver follows the standard V4L2 subsystem architecture with VR-specific extensions:

1. **Core Module**: Handles device initialization, configuration, and control
2. **V4L2 Subdev Interface**: Provides standard video device interface
3. **I2C Transport Layer**: Communicates with the sensor over I2C
4. **DMA Buffer Management**: Manages zero-copy buffer sharing
5. **Multi-Camera Synchronization**: Coordinates multiple cameras for synchronized operation

## Hardware Interface

The OV9281 camera connects to the system through:

- **I2C Bus**: For register configuration and control
- **MIPI CSI-2**: For high-speed image data transfer
- **GPIO**: For hardware synchronization between multiple cameras
- **DMA**: For zero-copy buffer sharing with the TPU
