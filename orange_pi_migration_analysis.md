## 5. Open Questions and Concerns

1. **Hardware Availability**: What is the procurement timeline for Orange Pi CM5 development boards?

2. **Documentation Quality**: Is there additional documentation available beyond what's publicly accessible?

3. **Community Support**: Are there Orange Pi engineers available for technical consultation?

4. **Firmware Availability**: Are all necessary firmware blobs available for peripherals?

5. **Certification Requirements**: Any changes to certification requirements with the new hardware?

6. **Performance Validation**: How will we validate that the Orange Pi CM5 meets VR performance requirements?

7. **Long-term Support**: What is Orange Pi's track record for long-term support and updates?

## 6. Conclusion

The migration from Radxa CM5 to Orange Pi CM5 is technically feasible with significant benefits (4x memory at the same cost). Most of our existing SLAM and driver work can be preserved with adaptation, while new components (audio, power management, system UI) need to be developed regardless of platform.

The primary challenges are in device tree adaptation, driver compatibility, and the less comprehensive documentation for Orange Pi. However, these challenges are manageable with proper planning and risk mitigation strategies.
