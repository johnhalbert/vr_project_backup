# Configuration Categories Implementation - Deliverables

This document provides an overview of the Configuration Categories implementation for the VR Headset project. All configuration categories have been successfully implemented, providing a comprehensive configuration system for the VR headset.

## Implemented Configuration Categories

### 1. Hardware Configuration
- **Display Settings**: Brightness, resolution, refresh rate, color calibration, and VR-specific optimizations
- **Audio Settings**: Volume control, spatial audio configuration, microphone settings, and audio device management
- **Tracking Settings**: Calibration, boundary configuration, sensitivity adjustments, and tracking quality metrics
- **Power Settings**: Battery management, power profiles, thermal management, and power-saving modes
- **Storage Settings**: Cache management, storage allocation, encryption, and performance optimization
- **Peripheral Settings**: Controller configuration, external device management, and connection settings

### 2. Network Configuration
- **WiFi Settings**: Connection management, preferred networks, security settings, and power management
- **Bluetooth Settings**: Device pairing, connection management, service discovery, and power settings
- **Streaming Settings**: Quality control, bandwidth management, latency optimization, and codec selection
- **Firewall Settings**: Application permissions, security rules, and network protection
- **VPN Settings**: Connection profiles, security configuration, and routing rules
- **QoS Settings**: Traffic prioritization for VR applications, bandwidth allocation, and latency management

### 3. System Configuration
- **Performance Settings**: CPU/GPU allocation, thermal management, and performance profiles
- **Update Settings**: Automatic updates, scheduling, and version management
- **Security Settings**: Authentication, encryption, and system-level security controls
- **Accessibility Settings**: Comfort options, assistance features, and interface adaptations
- **Language Settings**: UI language, voice recognition, and text-to-speech configuration
- **Time and Date Settings**: Timezone configuration, format preferences, and synchronization options

### 4. User Configuration
- **Profile Settings**: User accounts, preferences, and profile management
- **Notification Settings**: Alert types, priority levels, and delivery methods
- **Privacy Settings**: Data collection controls, permissions management, and privacy protections
- **Appearance Settings**: UI themes, customization options, and visual preferences
- **Input Settings**: Control schemes, button mapping, and input device configuration
- **Comfort Settings**: IPD adjustment, lens distance, and physical comfort options

## Implementation Details

All configuration categories have been implemented in the Core API Layer, providing a consistent interface for configuration management across the system. The implementation follows these key principles:

1. **TOML-Based Storage**: All configuration data is stored in TOML format, providing human-readable and easily editable configuration files.

2. **Schema Validation**: Each configuration category includes a schema definition that enforces type safety and validation rules.

3. **Versioning Support**: Configuration files include version information to support migration between different schema versions.

4. **Default Values**: Sensible defaults are provided for all configuration options to ensure system functionality even with minimal configuration.

5. **User Profiles**: Configuration can be stored on a per-user basis, allowing multiple users to maintain their own preferences.

6. **Tiered Access**: Configuration options are organized into tiers (Quick Access, Standard, Advanced, Developer) to provide appropriate levels of complexity.

7. **Change Notification**: Changes to configuration values trigger notifications to relevant system components for immediate application.
